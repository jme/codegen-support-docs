# Omissions and Deviations
The generated code adheres strictly to the PRD. The following items from the Knowledge Graph's documentation lore and the PRD's future considerations were not implemented, as they fall outside the scope of the v1.0 requirements.

* Formal Test Suites: The PRD lists this under "Future Considerations." No testing framework or test cases were implemented.

* Logging Framework: Also listed under "Future Considerations." The application only prints a startup message to the console; no structured logging is included.

* Exhaustive README Documentation: While a comprehensive README.md was generated based on the KG's structural requirements (clj:ReadmeReqs), highly detailed sections for "Testing Strategy" and "Performance Notes" were omitted as they are not applicable to this simple v1.0 application.
