As a very senior software engineer, with over a decade of experience using the Clojure language ecosystem, Use the included PRD (prd-simple-sec.md), in conjunction with the RDF-based comprehensive design, dependency,  documentation & guidance lore knowledge graph (kg.ttl) to generate the described web server application, including any associated project artifacts. Afterwards list any task and/or documentation items that were NOT implemented, and the reasons for their omission.                 

The PRD shall be considered the Source of Truth for this code generation process; Any conflicts between Knowledge Graph Lore and the PRD shall be resovled in favor of the PRD.

After generating the code, perform a final, rigorous syntax and balance check on all parentheses, brackets, and braces to ensure the code is fully compilable and free of any errant characters.         

Keep a running list of each element from the Primary Knowledge Graph (kg.ttl) that is actually used for the generation of the app, along with the inferred semantic requirement that required the usage. Provide this list at the end of the generation process.
Also provide a similar list of the Primary Knowledge Graph elements that WERE used in the generation of the app.
