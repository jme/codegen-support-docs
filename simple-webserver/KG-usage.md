### Knowledge Graph Usage

The following elements from `kg.ttl` were used to fulfill specific requirements from `prd-simple-webserver-sec.md`.

| Knowledge Graph Element Used                                      | Semantic Requirement Fulfilled (from PRD)                                                                                                                                                           |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `proj:simple-server`, `doap:version`, `dcterms:description`       | Defines the project name, version, and description used in `project.clj` and `README.md`.                                                                                                           |
| `proj:dependsOn` (all `proj:dep-*` entries)                       | Provided the exact dependency list and versions for `project.clj`. Required to build a functional web server.                                                                                       |
| `clj:DepExample`                                                  | The code snippet showing how to document dependencies was used to format the `:dependencies` section in `project.clj`.                                                                              |
| `css:rule-body` (`background-color`, `color`)                     | **NFR-1.4, NFR-1.5**: Implemented the required green text on a dark gray background.                                                                                                                |
| `css:rule-body` (`display`, `align-items`, etc.)                  | **FR-1.3**: Implemented the vertical centering of content for the home page (and by extension, the 404 page).                                                                                       |
| `clj:security-headers`, `clj:wrap-security-headers`               | **NFR-2.4**: Directly implemented the required security invariant headers. The entire map and middleware function were used exactly as defined.                                                     |
| `clj:layout`(`proj:includesStylesheet`)                           | **NFR-1.2, NFR-1.1**: Defined the HTML structure and linked the external CSS file, fulfilling the requirement to use a separate CSS file for all styling.                                           |
| `clj:home-handler`(`proj:returnsStatus`, `proj:returnsBody`)      | **FR-1.1, FR-1.2, NFR-2.1**: Generated the home page handler, ensuring the correct text ("X Y Z Z Y"), path (`/`), and `200 OK` status code.                                                        |
| `clj:not-found-handler`(`proj:returnsStatus`, `proj:returnsBody`) | **FR-2.1, FR-2.2, FR-2.3, NFR-2.2**: Generated the 404 page handler, ensuring the correct text, behavior for non-existent routes, and `404 Not Found` status.                                       |
| `clj:app-routes`                                                  | Defined the core routing logic, mapping paths to the correct handlers as required by the functional requirements for the home and 404 pages.                                                        |
| `clj:app` (middleware chain)                                      | **NFR-1.2, NFR-2.3**: Assembled the final Ring app. `wrap-resource` was essential for serving the CSS file, and `wrap-content-type` helped ensure the `Content-Type: text/html` header was present. |
| `clj:main`                                                        | Provided the structure for the application's main entry point, responsible for starting the Jetty server.                                                                                           |
| `clj:StructExample`, `clj:ArchExample`                            | Provided the content and structure for the namespace docstring in `core.clj` and the Architecture section (including the Mermaid diagram) in `README.md`.                                           |
| /`file:style_css`(`rdfs:comment`)                                 | The comment in the KG explaining where the CSS file is served from was directly used as a comment in the generated `style.`                                                                         |


## Unused KG elements
Based on the v1.0 requirements in the PRD, several elements from the `kg.ttl` Knowledge Graph were not used in the generation of the application. These primarily fall into the "documentation lore" category, representing standards or requirements for features that were not in scope.

Here is a list of the unused elements and the reasons for their omission:

### 1. Implementation Documentation Requirements

- **Element:** `[ doc:forTarget "tests"; rdfs:comment "Document the test strategy, edge cases, and performance tests." ]`
    
- **Reason:** This requirement, part of `clj:ImplReqs`, was not used because the PRD scoped out formal test suites for version 1.0, listing them as a "Future Consideration." Since no tests were written, no documentation for them was required.
    

### 2. Documentation Key Points

Several high-level principles defined under `clj:Standard` were not applicable to this simple application and therefore not used in the generated documentation (`README.md` or docstrings).

- **Element:** `[ rdfs:comment "Explain performance characteristics" ]`
    
- **Reason:** The application is too simple to have meaningful performance characteristics to document. This would be relevant for a more complex system with database access or heavy computation.
    
- **Element:** `[ rdfs:comment "Document test strategies" ]`
    
- **Reason:** Same as above; with no tests implemented, there was no strategy to document.
    

### 3. Documentation Lore Schema (Ontology)

The following elements define the _structure_ of the documentation knowledge graph itself. While they guided the interpretation of the KG, they were not directly used to generate any content in the final code, CSS, or markdown files. They are the abstract classes and properties of the documentation ontology.

- **Classes:**
    
    - `doc:DocumentationStandard`
        
    - `doc:Context`
        
    - `doc:RequirementCategory`
        
    - `doc:Requirement`
        
    - `doc:Example`
        
    - `doc:KeyPoint`
        
- **Properties:**
    
    - `doc:hasContext`
        
    - `doc:hasRequirementCategory`
        
    - `doc:hasRequirement`
        
    - `doc:hasExample`
        
    - `doc:hasKeyPoint`
        
    - `doc:hasCodeSnippet`
        
    - `doc:forTarget`
        

In essence, every element related to features, dependencies, code structure, and styling defined in the KG was used. The only unused elements were those related to documentation practices for features (like testing) that the PRD explicitly excluded from the initial version.
