# Product Requirements Document: Project "XYZ"

## 1.0 Introduction
This document outlines the product requirements for Project "XYZ," a simple web application. The primary goal of this initial version (v1.0) is to establish a foundational web server that delivers a styled home page and a corresponding 404 error page. This document serves as the source of truth for development, ensuring that the delivered product meets the specified criteria. It is intended to be a living document, evolving as the project accrues new features and bug fixes.

## 2.0 Vision and Strategy
The vision for Project "XYZ" is to create a robust, scalable, and web application. This initial phase focuses on establishing a solid architectural foundation, emphasizing the separation of concerns (content and styling) and adherence to standard web protocols and best practices. By starting with a minimal feature set, we can ensure that core non-functional requirements are met before building out more complex functionality.

## 3.0 Target Audience

The primary audience for this document is internal development teams, including but not limited to other Language Model-based development agents, software engineers, and quality assurance analysts. The structure and content are optimized for machine readability to facilitate automated parsing and implementation.

## 4.0 Assumptions and Dependencies
* **Assumption:** The development environment has the capability to serve static files (specifically CSS).
* **Dependency:** A hosting environment capable of running a web server and responding to HTTP requests.

## 5.0 Requirements

### 5.1 Functional Requirements

#### 5.1.1 Home Page
* **FR-1.1:** The server MUST provide a home page accessible at the root URL (`/`).
* **FR-1.2:** The home page MUST display the exact text "X Y Z Z Y".
* **FR-1.3:** The text "X Y Z Z Y" MUST be vertically centered on the page.

#### 5.1.2 404 Not Found Page
* **FR-2.1:** The server MUST provide a custom 404 "Not Found" error page.
* **FR-2.2:** The 404 page MUST be served when a user requests a route that does not exist.
* **FR-2.3:** The 404 page MUST display the exact text "You have entered the void. There is no one here. There is no place to go. There is no lamp.‚Äù

### 5.2 Non-Functional Requirements

#### 5.2.1 Styling and User Interface
* **NFR-1.1:** All styling for the application MUST be implemented using CSS.
* **NFR-1.2:** All CSS MUST be located in a separate, static CSS file.
* **NFR-1.3:** Inline styling is strictly PROHIBITED.
* **NFR-1.4:** The text color for both the home page and the 404 page MUST be green.
* **NFR-1.5:** The background color for both the home page and the 404 page MUST be dark gray.
* **NFR-1.6:** The visual styling of the 404 page MUST be identical to the styling of the home page.

#### 5.2.2 Server Behavior and Performance
* **NFR-2.1:** Successful responses (e.g., for the home page) MUST return an HTTP status code of `200 OK`.
* **NFR-2.2:** Responses for non-existent routes MUST return an HTTP status code of `404 Not Found`.
* **NFR-2.3:** All server responses MUST contain a `Content-Type: text/html` header entry.

## 6.0 Future Considerations

While not in scope for v1.0, future iterations may include:

* Expansion of content beyond the home page.
* Introduction of interactive elements.
* Implementation of a logging framework for server requests and errors.
* Formalized test suites for functional and non-functional requirements.
